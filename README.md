# IvyEFI1015
EFI for my Coffeetosh

DISCLAMER - OPENCORE 0.6.0

I've had really bad luck with Hackintosh (Running macOS on non-Apple Hardware), and I mean REALLY BAD.

I myself have an MSI B365 Pro VDH (Mind you, a chipset that people are told to AVOID when it comes to Hackintosh, and a
i5-9400 running at 2.9GHz (Base) using UHD 630.

The reasoning of me uploading this is because I lose a lot of my things, the other day I accidentally formatted a hard drive because of "Logical Drives" in Windows...

nonetheless...I need a backup of this, because it's important? i guess. Ever since my Dell Optiplex XE2 to this machine now "Ivy" I've had bad luck and this EFI has worked! 
I need to keep it and if you wanna try it, go right ahead! 

**CHIPSETS SUPPORTED**

That's really all I have to say, I'm not responsible if this fucks with your system (which is technically impossible).

If you need any help head to Dortania, I'm not your guy. This is really just for keep sake but if you wanna try and use it go ahead.
